**Simple Telegram Moderator Bot**


Hello there! This is my third telegram bot - **bot-moderator for Telegram!**

**What can he do**
So far, it has **limited functionality**: 
Its capabilities:

 1. /ban - member ban (temporary banning system will be implemented)
 2. /mute - mute the member (the system will be implemented in the same
    way as with the ban)
 3. /start - start bot
 4. /stop - stop the bot (it can be started by /start)
 5. /warn - warning. If a member has 2 warnings, the bot will warn him
    (this can be adjusted in the bot code (number of warnings))
 6. /clear_warnings - removes all warnings from the member
 7. /unban -unlocks the banned member. If he presses start in the bot,
    you will receive a link to unban the member

***That's all the functionality for now, more updates soon :)*** 



**TODO**:

 - [ ] Make a system of temporary bans
 - [ ] Add bot message design
